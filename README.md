# presence-check
To know that you are here.

This is a simple website that I made. It does nothing except confirming your presence and logging it in a database along with the date.
This was my first time working on AWS and I wanted to familiarize myself with the framework and a few of its many services.

If you wish to see the website for yourself here is a link:

The unsightly name is caused by my unwillingness to pay for a domain to such a simple hobby project.
